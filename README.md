YOLO : State-of-the-Art & Implementation

This project provides an in-depth analysis of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) real-time object detection system, tracing its technical evolution from its inception to the latest YOLOv8 version. It explores key advancements and contributions made across all versions, offering forward-looking insights and identifying potential research directions to optimize real-time object detection.

Additionally, the project includes an [https://ayoub-mg.github.io/YOLOv8/Comprehensive%20Review/Render.pdf](arXiv paper) detailing the findings, alongside an interactive Streamlit application. A pre-trained object detection model was also fine-tuned using Python to enhance its real-time performance and applicability.
